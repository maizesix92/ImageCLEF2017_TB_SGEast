# Models for ImageCLEF2017: Tuberculosis task (SGEast) -- Repo In Progress
This repository contains the weights of the neural network structures that we used in the ImageCLEF tuberculosis task. The team would like to share our models for further improvements.

### About us


### About the Task
The tuberculosis task can be further divided into 2 sub-tasks:
1) Multi-Drug-Resistant Detection
2) Detection of Tuberculosis type

More information about the challenge can be found on this website:
http://www.imageclef.org/2017/tuberculosis

### Libraries Used
We used 2 libraries for training our neural network. 
1. Caffe -- https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
2. Keras (with Theano backend) -- https://keras.io/ & http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/


### Performance
Below shows the performance of our models, based on the evaluation standards of the ImageCLEF committee. 
#### Task 1 (MDR Detection)
CNN-LSTM model

\ Table eg
\TODO add more stuff

Rank 4 out of 28
#### Task 2 (TB-Type Detection)
CNN model

Rank 1 out of 23
