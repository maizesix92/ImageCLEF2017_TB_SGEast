# Models for ImageCLEF2017: Tuberculosis task (SGEast)
This repository contains the weights of the neural network structures 

### About the Task
The tuberculosis task can be further divided into 2 sub-tasks:
1) Multi-Drug-Resistant Detection
2) Detection of Tuberculosis type

More information about the challenge can be found on this website:

### Performance
Below shows the performance of our models, based on the evaluation standards of the ImageCLEF committee. 
#### Task 1 (MDR Detection)
CNN-LSTM model

\ Table eg
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

\TODO add more stuff

Rank 4 out of 28
#### Task 2 (TB-Type Detection)
CNN model

Rank 1 out of 23
